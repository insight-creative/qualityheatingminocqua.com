Ductless air conditioners and ductless heat pumps, also known as ductless mini split systems, can fit in any space, even where traditional HVAC units don't. With their virtually endless configurations, ductless air conditioners and heat pumps deliver comfort with minimal visual impact. Ductless systems are different from traditional split systems because they come in all shapes and sizes, and don’t require ducts inside your walls. These solutions are flexible and work wherever you need them.
