testimonials:
  - testimonial: Quality Heating is an outstanding company. We called last Thursday mid afternoon because our AC went out. We had friends arriving for the weekend and it was hot! They arrived within 1 hour and replaced the compressor. Checked the entire unit and thermostat out. Professional, friendly. We can't thank them enough.

  - testimonial: Great experience with Quality Heating. Had a problem with the condensate pump. Jeff came out next day and was very professional and knowledgeable. Cost was more than fair. Highly recommend them.
